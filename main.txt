1. Initializing git repo and making first commit.

2. Creating webpack.config.js and
  2.1. Adding statis: { directory: "./dist" } for serving from that directory.
  2.2. Adding devtool: false for webpack generated files was more readable.

3. Installing babel-loader @babel/core and @babel/preset-env (and @babel/preset-react for future)
  3.1. Creating babel.config.js.
  3.2. Updating webpack config with modules property, that contained rules property, that contained list of objects with:
    - rules -- what files to transpile (regex used for in that case)
    - exclude -- ignore files (node_modules in that case)
    - use.loader -- name of loader (babel-loader in that case)

  After call npm run build babel will transform js code to older versions (for vast compatibility)

4. Updating webpack.config.js adding mode switch from prod to dev and updating package.json scripts adding different command "build-dev": "webpack" for dev and changing "build" command with "NODE_ENV=production webpack"

5. CSS loader.
  5.1. Installing css-loader and mini-css-extract-plugin.
  There is style-loader as alternative. It injected styles in js bundler, whereas mini-css-extract-plugin is create recources (one final .css file).

  style-loader - for partial css.
  mini-css-extract-plugin - for one big .css file.

  5.2. Updating webpack.config.js with one more rule for .css files.
    Adding plugins field with array contained "mini-css-extract-plugin" object created inside it.

  5.3. Adding .broserslistrc for trasform css for compatibility.

6. Images supporting.
  6.1. Adding new rule /.(png|gif|jpe?g|svg)/i, 
  6.2. Types of implementing:
    - "asset": automatic determine whether it should be like a module and whether it should be like an inline based on maxSize (8kb)
    - "asset/resource": genrate paths to the imgs inside code
    - "asset/inline": place whole image inside code but not import it as path (imgs do not appear inside dist folder)
  6.3. Change default max size of image (for inserting whole image inside code);
    ```javascript
    parser: {
      dataUrlCondition: {
        maxSize: 130 * 1024,
      },
    }
    ```

7. HTML generation. Add html-webpack-plugin for html generation and clean-webpack-plugin for removing dist before building process.

8. Hot module replacement.
  8.1. Configurating HMR.
