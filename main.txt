1. Initializing git repo and making first commit.

2. Creating webpack.config.js and
  2.1. Adding statis: { directory: "./dist" } for serving from that directory.
  2.2. Adding devtool: false for webpack generated files was more readable.

3. Installing babel-loader @babel/core and @babel/preset-env (and @babel/preset-react for future)
  3.1. Creating babel.config.js.
  3.2. Updating webpack config with modules property, that contained rules property, that contained list of objects with:
    - rules -- what files to transpile (regex used for in that case)
    - exclude -- ignore files (node_modules in that case)
    - use.loader -- name of loader (babel-loader in that case)

  After call npm run build babel will transform js code to older versions (for vast compatibility)

4. Updating webpack.config.js adding mode switch from prod to dev and updating package.json scripts adding different command "build-dev": "webpack" for dev and changing "build" command with "NODE_ENV=production webpack"
